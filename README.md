# Introduction

The e-Money Ledger, a proof-of-stake blockchain based on the [Cosmos SDK](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk) and [Tendermint](https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint), introduces our novel interest-bearing, currency-backed tokens into the [Cosmos Network](https://cosmos.network).

## Build Instructions

```bash
git clone https://github.com/e-money/em-ledger.git
cd em-ledger
make build
```

## Getting Started

To better understand em-ledger, start with a [quick tour](docs/emd.md) of the `emd` command line interface.

The [emoneyjs library](https://github.com/e-money/emoneyjs) is the recommended way for client applications to interact with em-ledger.

_Please notice that it is highly recommended to use a [Ledger Device](docs/ledger.md) to securely manage keys._

## Networks
